Figure 1
Melanoma patients exhibited different genetic profiles on the scRNA transcriptome level. 
(A) UMAP plot of 981 melanoma cells aggregated in six Louvain clusters. 
(B) Clustering tree for the melanoma cells clustered using various resolution parameters (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2). 
(C) UMAP plot showing patient sample distribution among the melanoma clusters. 
(D) The top 10 DEGs of each melanoma cell cluster are visualized by a heatmap.
